# Movie Recommendation System

This is a simple movie recommendation system built using Python and a dataset containing movie ratings and information. The system suggests movies to users based on their preferences and past ratings. It uses collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations.

### Features:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user ratings.
- **Dataset**: The system uses a dataset of movies and their ratings to generate suggestions.
- **User-based and Item-based Recommendation**: Offers both user-item collaborative filtering techniques.

### Files:
- **`Untitled.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for building and running the recommendation system.
- **`movies.csv`**: Contains information about movies, including their IDs, titles, and genres.
- **`ratings.csv`**: Contains user ratings for movies, with columns for user IDs, movie IDs, and the ratings given.

### Installation and Setup:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanshika161/Movie-recommendation.git
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the recommendation system**:
   - Open the `Untitled.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Execute the cells to run the movie recommendation system.

### How to Use:
1. Load the `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv` files into the system.
2. Use collaborative filtering methods (e.g., user-based or item-based filtering) to generate movie recommendations for users based on their ratings.
3. The system outputs movie recommendations and suggests new movies to users based on their past behavior.

### Testing:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook and run the necessary cells.
2. You can modify the rating data or add new user preferences to test the system's flexibility.

### Project Structure:
- **`Untitled.ipynb`**: Python code for the movie recommendation system.
- **`movies.csv`**: Movie details like ID, title, and genre.
- **`ratings.csv`**: User ratings for movies.
